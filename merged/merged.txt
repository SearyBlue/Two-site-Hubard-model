aa I have two lattice sites, indexed by 1 and 2, occupied by electrons. µ is the chemical
potential, c†iσ and ciσ are the fermionic creation and annihilation operators at the ith site, with
spin-index σ. σ can take values ↑ and ↓, denoting spin-up and spin-down states respectively.
n̂iσ = c†iσ ciσ is the number operator for the ith site and atP
spin-index σ; it counts the number of
fermions with the designated quantum numbers. N̂ = iσ n̂iσ is the total number operator;
it counts the total number of fermions at all sites and spin-indices. t is the hopping strength;
the more the t, the more are the electrons likely to hop between sites. U is the on-site
repulsion cost; it represents the increase in energy when two electrons occupy the same site.

1.1

Symmetries of the problem

The following operators commute with the Hamiltonian.
h
i
1. Total number operator: H, N̂ = 0.
Proof. The last term in the Hamiltonian is the number operator itself. Ignoring that,
there are three terms that I need to individually consider.

= δσ,σ0 c†1σ c1σ (δi,2 − δi,1 )
The third line follows because the electrons on different sites are distinguishable
and hence, the creation and anhillation operators of different sites will commute
among themselves. Therefore,

c†1σ c2σ , N̂ =

(δi,2 − δi,1 ) = 0

iσ 0

i={1,2}

• c†2σ c1σ : Since the operator N̂ is symmetric with respect to the site indices 1 and
2, I can go through the last proof again with the site indices 1 and 2 exchanged
and since the proof does not depend on the site indices, this commutator will also
be zero.

• n̂i↑ n̂i↓ :
[n̂i↑ n̂j↓ , n̂jσ ] = n̂i↑ [n̂i↓ , n̂jσ ] − [n̂i↑ , n̂jσ ] n̂i↓
= δij (n̂i↑ [n̂i↓ , n̂iσ ] − [n̂i↑ , n̂iσ ] n̂i↓ )
= δij (δσ↑ n̂i↑ [n̂i↓ , n̂i↑ ] − δσ↓ [n̂i↑ , n̂i↓ ] n̂i↓ )

Therefore, n̂i↑ n̂j↓ , N̂ =

P

j,σ

(4)

[n̂i↑ n̂j↓ , n̂jσ ] = 0

The total Hamiltonian is just a sum of the three terms; since the number operator
commutes individually with these terms, it obviously commutes with the total Hamiltonian.

N̂ − 2 i n̂i↓ . Since N̂ commutes with H, I just need to prove that [H, i n̂i↓ ]. From

Again using the symmetry
of the
i magnetization operator with the exchange of indices,
h

†
its obvious that c2σ c1σ , i n̂i↓ = 0
Using eq. 4, [n̂i↑ n̂i↓ , n̂i↓ ] = 0.
P
z
Finally, [N, n̂i↓ ] = jσ [n̂jσ , n̂i↓ ] = [n̂i↑ , n̂i↓ ] = c†i↑ ci↑ c†i↓ ci↓ − c†i↓ ci↓ c†i↑ ci↑ = 0. Since Ŝtot
commutes with each part individually, it commutes with the total Hamiltonian.
3. Two-site parity operator P̂ : The action of P̂ is defined as follows. If |Ψαβ i is a
wavefunction with site indices α and β,
P̂ |Ψ(α, β)i = |Ψ(β, α)i

(6)

That is, it operates on each electron and reverses it’s site indices.
Proof. I now rewrite the Hamiltonian by explcitly showing the two site indices:
X
X
H(α, β) = −t
(c†ασ cβσ + c†βσ cασ ) + U (nα↑ nα↓ + nβ↑ nβ↓ ) − µ
(nασ + nβσ )
σ

σ

(7)

Its obvious that H is symmetric in the site indices: H(α, β) = H(β, α). This means
that the eigenvalues also have this symmetry. Let |Φ(α, β)i be an eigenstate of H(α, β)
with eigenvalue E(α, β). Then,
P̂ H |Φ(α, β)i = E(α, β)P̂ |Φ(α, β)i = E(β, α) |Φ(β, α)i
= H |Φ(β, α)i = HP̂ |Φ(α, β)i

(8)

=⇒ HP̂ |Φ(α, β)i = P̂ H |Φ(α, β)i
Since any general wavefunction can be expanded in terms of these wavefunctions and
since both the operator are linear, the above result will also hold for a general wavefunction |Ψ(α, β)i:
HP̂ |Ψ(α, β)i = P̂ H |Ψ(α, β)i =⇒ [H, P̂ ] = 0

1.2

Partitioning the Hilbert space

THe Hamiltonian commutes with the three operators. This means that is possible to simultaneously diagonalize these four operators: H, N̂ , Sztot , P̂ . I will be able to label the
eigenstates of the total Hamiltonian using the eigenvalues of these operatos. First take the
total number operator. N̂ can take four values for a two-site system, 1 through 4. The
eigenstates labelled by a particular number, say N=2 will be orthogonal to the eigenstates
labelled by another number, say N=4. This means each eigenvalue of N̂ will have a distinct
subspace orthogonal to the other values of N̂ . I will be able to diagonalize each such subspace
independently of each other, because they will not have any overlap. This feature enables
us to block-diagonalize the total Hamiltonian into four blocks, each block belonging to each
value N̂ .
Inside each block, I will be able to repeat the procedure by next using the eigenvalues of
Sztot . Each block of the Hamiltonian will again break up to smaller blocks for each value of
the total magnetization. The eigenvalues of parity operator provide a further partitioning of
the blocks of magnetization.
From this point, all the states I will work with will necessarily be eigenfunctions of N̂ , so it
doesn’t make sense to keep the last term in the Hamiltonian,
µN̂ . I redefine the Hamiltonian
P  †
P
†
by absorbing this term: H → H + µN̂ = −t σ c1σ c2σ + c2σ c1σ + U i n̂i↑ n̂i↓ . This will
keep the eigenvectors unaltered, but will increase the eigenvalues by µN , where N is the
number of particles in the eigenstate I are considering.

1.3

N=1

For writing the state kets, I use the following notation: |↑, ↓i means electron on site 1 has
spin up and that on site 2 has spin-down. |↓, 0i means electron on site 1 has spin-down and
there is no electron on site 2.

5

For one electron on two lattice sites, I start by writing down the eigenstates of Sztot . For
odd number of electrons, zero magnetization is not possible. So,
• Sztot = −1: |↓, 0i , |0, ↓i
• Sztot = +1: |↑, 0i , |0, ↑i
Each eigenvalue will have a separate subspace and can be separately diagonalized. I need to
find the matrix elements of H in these eigenkets. Since there is no possibility of two electrons
occupying same site, I ignore the U -term for the time being.
1.3.1

Sztot = −1

Let us first see the action of the Hamiltonian on the eigenfunctions with Sztot = −1.
H |↓, 0i = −tc†2↓ c1↓ |↓, 0i = −t |0, ↓i
H |0, ↓i = −tc†1↓ c2↓ |0, ↓i = −t |↓, 0i

(10)

We get the following matrix for this tiny subspace of the Hamiltonian:
|↓, 0i |0, ↓i
|↓, 0i



0

−t








|0, ↓i

−t

(11)

0

√
The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix are |↓,0i±|0,↓i
, with eigenvalues ∓t. These are
2
also the eigenvalues of the parity operator, as expected.

P̂ (|↓, 0i + |0, ↓i) = |0, ↓i + |↓, 0i =⇒ P̂ = 1
P̂ (|↓, 0i − |0, ↓i) = |0, ↓i − |↓, 0i =⇒ P̂ = −1
1.3.2

(12)

Sztot = +1

Now I look at the spin-up states.
H |↑, 0i = −tc†2↑ c1↑ |↑, 0i = −t |0, ↑i
H |0, ↑i = −tc†1↑ c2↑ |0, ↑i = −t |↑, 0i

(13)

Clearly, this gives the same matrix as the spin-down states:
|↑, 0i |0, ↑i
|↑, 0i



and hence similar eigenfunctions:

I once again write down the eigenstates of Sztot , this time with three electrons.
• Sztot = −1: |↑↓, ↓i , |↓, ↑↓i
• Sztot = +1: |↑↓, ↑i , |↑, ↑↓i
1.4.1

N=4

With four electrons, the only possible state is |↑↓, ↑↓i. Its easy to find the eigenvalue. Since
all states are filled, no hopping can take place, so the hopping term is zero. Therefore,
H |↑↓, ↑↓i = 2U |↑↓, ↑↓i
So, |↑↓, ↑↓i is an eigenvector with eigenvalue 2U .

(19)

1.6

N=2

This is the eigenvalue that has the largest subspace.
• Sztot = −1: |↓, ↓i
• Sztot = +1: |↑, ↑i
• Sztot = 0: |↑, ↓i , |↓, ↑i , |0, ↑↓i , |↑↓, 0i
1.6.1

Sztot = ±1

These two subspaces have a single state each, so theya are obviously eigenstates. Since they
both have identical spins on both sites, the hopping term is 0, and the U -term is also zero
because of single occupation. As a result, they both have zero eigenvalue
H |↓, ↓i = H |↑, ↑i = 0
1.6.2

(20)

Sztot = 0

This subspace has four eigenvectors,
|↑, ↓i ,

|↓, ↑i ,

|0, ↑↓i ,

|↑↓, 0i

(21)

so it is not possible to directly diagonalize this subspace. First we organize these states into
eigenstates of parity. It is easy by inspection.
P̂ (|↑, ↓i ± |↓, ↑i) = ± (|↑, ↓i ± |↓, ↑i)
P̂ (|↑↓, 0i ± |0, ↑↓i) = ± (|↑↓, 0i ± |0, ↑↓i)

(22)

I have the parity eigenstates for this subspace, so its most convenient to work in the basis
of these eigenstates
• P̂ = 1 :

• The separation between the two bands is ∆ = U . The kets in the lower band are formed
mostly of superpositions of the Neel states (singly occupied states with opposite spin)
as well as the polarised states (singly occupied states with same spin). This is expected
because for very large U , it becomes the only determining factor, and states with single
occupation will be appreciably lower in energy compared to the doubly occupied states,
and hence will gather in the lower band.
• For exactly the same reason, the upper band will be formed mostly by superpositions
of holon-doublon states (two electrons on one site and none on the other), because
they will incur the heavy cost of the on-site repulsion energy, and will hence assemble
in the upper band.
• The lower band is a collection of three states: the ground state is the singlet state

|↑, ↓i − |↓, ↑i, with an energy of − 4tU , while the other three , |↑, ↑i , |↓, ↓i , |↑, ↓i + |↓, ↑i,

The |↑↑i and |↓↓i form eigenkets with eigenvalues J each. The middle 2 × 2 matrix can
easily be diagonalised. It gives two other eigenvectors |↑↓i ± |↓↑i, with eigenvalues J, −3J.
After adding the constant term −J to these eigenvalues, the final spectrum becomes
• |↑↑i : 0
• |↓↓i : 0
• |↑↓i + |↓↑i : 0
• |↑↓i − |↓↑i : −4J

Recognizing J as − tU , we get the same spectrum as the lower block.

I have two lattice sites, indexed by 1 and 2, occupied by electrons. µ is the chemical potential,
c†iσ and ciσ are the fermionic creation and annihilation operators at the ith site, with spin-index
σ. σ can take values ↑ and ↓, denoting spin-up and spin-down states respectively. n̂iσ = c†iσ ciσ
is the number operator for the ith site and at P
spin-index σ; it counts the number of fermions
with the designated quantum numbers. N̂ = iσ n̂iσ is the total number operator; it counts
the total number of fermions at all sites and spin-indices. t is the hopping strength; the more
the t, the more are the electrons likely to hop between sites. U is the on-site repulsion cost;
it represents the increase in energy when two electrons occupy the same site. The model has
on-site repulsion only for the first site. The sites have energies of s and s respectively.

Since all the terms in the Hamiltonian are spin-preserving (all events conserve the number of particles having a definite spin σ), total angular momentum will be conserved.
It’s obvious that the number operator term do so. The hopping term does so as well;
c†iσ cjσ destroys a particle of spin σ and creates a particle of the same spin; the total
angular momentum remain conserved in thehprocess,
i although the number of particles

Block diagonalization of a Fermionic Hamiltonian in
single Fermion number occupancy basis
The Problem

You have a system of N spin-half fermions. The corresponding Hamiltonian H2N comprises
2N fermionic single particle degrees of freedom defined in the number occupancy basis of
n̂iσ = c†iσ ciσ , for all [iσ] ∈ [1, N ] × [σ, −σ]. The corresponding Hilbert space has a dimension
16

of 22N . i represents some external degree of freedom like site-index for electrons on a lattice
or the electron momentum if we go to momentum-space. This Hamiltonian is in general
non-diagonal in the occupancy basis of a certain degree of freedom N σ. N σ can be taken
to be any degree of freedom, like say, the first lattice site or the largest momentum (Fermi
momentum for a fermi gas). Equivalenty, for a general H, [H, n̂N σ ] 6= 0. The goal is to
diagonalize this Hamiltonian.
Theorem 1. This Hamiltonian can be transformed using a certain unitary transformation
ÛN σ , into H = ÛN σ HÛN† σ such that this transformed Hamiltonian is diagonal in the occupancy
basis of n̂N σ .i A rephrased statement is, there exists a unitary operator ÛN σ such that
h
ÛN σ H2N ÛN† σ , n̂N σ = 0.

3.2

Warming Up - Writing the Hamiltonian as blocks

The Hamiltonian H2N in general has off-diagonal terms and can be written as the following
general matrix in the occupancy basis of N σ:

h1|
H2N =



|1i

|0i

H1

H2



h0|





H3

(51)

H4

where |1i ≡ |n̂N σ = 1i (occupied). Note that the Hi are not scalars but matrices(blocks), of
dimension half that of H2N , that is 22N −1 . Its clear that since, for example, H2 = h1| H2N |0i,
we have
(52)
H2N = H1 n̂N σ + c†N σ H2 + H3 cN σ + H4 (1 − n̂N σ )
Its trivial to check that this definition of H2N indeed gives back the mentioned matrix
elements. The expression for these matrix elements is quite easy to calculate. First, we
define the partial trace over the subspace N σ
X
T rN σ (H2N ) ≡
hN σ| H2N |N σi
(53)
|N σi

The sum is over the possible states of N σ, that is, n̂N σ = 0 and n̂N σ = 1. Applying this
partial trace to equation 52, after multiplying throughout with n̂N σ from the right, gives
h
i
†
T rN σ (H2N n̂N σ ) = T rN σ H1 n̂N σ n̂N σ + cN σ H2 n̂N σ + H3 cN σ n̂N σ + H4 (1 − n̂N σ )n̂N σ (54)
Recall the following: n̂2N σ = n̂N σ , (1 − n̂N σ )n̂N σ = 0.
Also, since Hi are matrix elements with respect to n̂N σ , they will commute with the creation
and annihilation operators. Hence, T rN σ (c†N σ H2 n̂N σ ) = H2 T rN σ (c†N σ n̂N σ ) = 0, because
c†N σ n̂N σ = 0.

17

Lastly, T rN σ (H3 cN σ n̂N σ ) = H3 T rN σ (cN σ n̂N σ ) = H3 T rN σ (n̂N σ cN σ ) = 0, because n̂N σ cN σ =
0. So,
T rN σ (H2N n̂N σ ) = T rN σ [H1 n̂N σ ] = H1 T rN σ n̂N σ = H1
(55)
This gives the expression for H1 . Similarly, by taking partial trace of H(1 − n̂N σ ), HcN σ and
c†N σ H, we get the expressions for all the blocks. They are listed here.
H1 ≡ ĤN σ,e = T rN σ [H2N n̂N σ ]
H2 ≡ T̂N σ,e−h = T rN σ [H2N cN σ ]
h
i
H3 ≡ TN† σ,e−h = T rN σ c†N σ H2N

(56)

H4 ≡ ĤN σ,h = T rN σ [H2N (1 − n̂N σ )]
We get the following block decomposition of the Hamiltonian.

Proof of the theorem

Define an operator PˆN σ = ÛN† σ n̂N σ ÛN σ . This is the roated version of the number operator.
What this does will be apparent from the following demonstration.

H2N , PˆN σ = H2N , ÛN† σ n̂N σ ÛN σ = H2N ÛN† σ n̂N σ ÛN σ − ÛN† σ n̂N σ ÛN σ H2N
= ÛN† σ H2N n̂N σ ÛN σ − ÛN† σ n̂N σ H2N ÛN σ = ÛN† σ [H2N , n̂N σ ] ÛN σ
=0

(59)

We see that PˆN σ is the operator that commutes with the original Hamiltonian. Note that
here we are not transforming the Hamiltonian. Instead we are changing the single particle
basis; PˆN σ is not the single-particle occupation basis n̂N σ , rather a unitarily transformed
version of that.This operator projects out the eigensubspaces of the diagonal Hamlitonian.
n̂N σ H2N n̂N σ will project out the subspace of the Hamiltonian in which the particle states are
occupied, but since the H2N is not diagonal, these will not be the eigensubspace. Instead,
PˆN σ H2N PˆN σ will project out the eigensubspace.
Both the approaches are mathematically equivalent; the matrix of H2N in the basis of PˆN σ
and the matrix of H2N in the basis of n̂N σ will be identical; they will both be block-diagonal
with the same blocks in the diagonal.
PˆN σ also has the following properties:

2
• PˆN σ = ÛN† σ n̂2N σ ÛN σ = ÛN† σ n̂N σ ÛN σ = PˆN σ

• PˆN σ (1 − PˆN σ ) = ÛN† σ n̂N σ (1 − n̂N σ )ÛN σ = 0

Its easy to see that if any matrix Â is written in the basis of some operator m̂, m̂Âm̂
returns the upper diagonal element of Â and (1 − m̂)Â(1 − m̂) returns the lower diagonal

2. (1 − n̂N σ )η̂N σ n̂N σ = ηN σ : this is expected from the fact that η̂N σ acts with non-zero
result only states of particle-number 1, and hence, n̂N σ will just give 1; after the action
of η̂N σ , we will get a state with hole (particle-number zero), so (1 − n̂N σ ) will just give
1.
3. n̂N σ η̂N σ (1 − n̂N σ ) = 0 : this is expected because 1 − n̂N σ will give non-zero result only
on hole states, but those states will give zero when acted upon by η̂N σ , because there
won’t be any electron to transition from.
These defining properties have many corrolaries in terms of properties of η̂N σ :

an expression for the ÛN σ . Operating equation 68 to the right of |1i (occupied eigenstate of

The basis used is the ordered set {|11i , |10i , |01i , |00i}
For this problem, we take N σ ≡ 1. 1 refers to the first site. First step is to represent
the Hamiltonian in block matrix form (equation 57).
Ĥ1,e = T r1 [Hn̂1 ]
= T r1 [V n̂1 n̂2 − µ(n̂1 + n̂2 )] c and c† will not conserve the eigenvalue of n̂

Next is calculation of Ĥ1,h :
Ĥ1,h = T r1 [H(1 − n̂1 )] = −µn̂2

(98)

Next is calculation of T1,e−h .
T1,e−h = T r1 [Hc1 ]
= T r1 [−tc†1 c2 c1 ] = −tc2

(the only term that conserves eigenvalue of n̂)

†
Therefore, T1,e−h

This equation gives the upper block of the diagonalised Hamiltonian. Why the upper block?
Because it is multiplied by n̂1 , and hence can give non-zero contribution only in the upper
block. It is also obvious that the upper block itself is internally diagonal in n̂2 ; this is seen
from the fact that the expression of H0 n̂1 has no c2 or c†2 , only n̂2 . The term multiplying n̂2
becomes the upper matrix element in the block of n̂2 , while that multiplying 1 − n̂2 becomes
the lower element. Summarizing,

block of H. It still remains to compute H00 (1 − n̂1 ) = Ê 0 (1 − n̂1 ). But that is easy because
we already have the expression for that, equation 89.
E10 (1 − n̂1 ) = Hh (1 − n̂1 ) − T̂1† c1 η † = −µ(1 − n̂1 )n̂2 − t2 c†2 c1 Ge c†1 ĉ2

(103)

This is the expression for the lower block. But to get the final matrix elements, we need to resolve it in n̂2 . That is, the upper matrix element of the lower block will be h01| E 0 (1− n̂1 ) |01i
and the lower element will be h00| E 0 (1 − n̂1 ) |00i. The bra and ket are written in the notation hn1 , n2 | , |n1 , n2 i. Since this is the lower block in the representation of n̂1 , n1 will always
be zero while calculating the elements of Ê 0 . n2 = 1(0) means the upper(lower) diagonal
element. Similarly, h01| E 0 (1 − n̂1 ) |00i is an off-diagonal element.
It is easy to see that the off-diagonal terms will be zero. The lower diagonal term will
also be zero: n̂2 |n1 , 0i = c2 |n1 , 0i = 0. Thus the only non-zero term is
h01| E 0 (1 − n̂1 ) |01i = −µ − t2 h10| Ge |10i

∴ h10| Ge |10i =

Therefore, h01| E (1 − n̂1 ) |01i = −µ − t2 1t = −µ − t. The final diagonalized matrix becomes

t2 (1 − n̂2 )2 = Ê1 − V n̂2 + µ(1 + n̂2 )

(108)

(109)

This has a solution, Ê1 − V n̂2 + µ(1 + n̂2 ) = t (1 − n̂2 ), that is,
Ê1 = V n̂2 − µ(1 + n̂2 ) + t (1 − n̂2 ) = (V − 2µ)n̂2 + (t − µ)(1 − n̂2 )

(110)

The lower diagonal block Ê 0 can be determined as follows. First note that in the original
Hamiltonian, only the upper 3 × 3 portion is interacting among themselves, the 4th row and
4th column of the Hamiltonian do not interact with the rest. This means that the lower
element of Ê 0 is zero. Also note that the unitary transformations do not alter the partial
trace of the matrix. Specifically,

Therefore, T r1 H = (V − 2µ)n̂2 + (t − µ)(1 − n̂2 ) + Ê10 n̂2 . From equation 100, T r1 (H) =
V n̂2 − µ(1 + n̂2 ) − µn̂2 . Equating the two traces, we get an expression for the lower block:

The Eigenstates

The unitarily transformed Hamiltonian, H is diagonal in the basis of n̂. This implies that
the eigenstates of the original Hamiltonian H are the unitarily transformed versions of the
eigenkets of n̂:
H(ÛN† σ |n1 , n2 i) = ÛN† σ H |n1 , n2 i = ÛN† σ En1 ,n2 |n1 , n2 i = En1 ,n2 (ÛN† σ |n1 , n2 i)

(116)

To find the eigenvectors
ÛN† σ |n1 , n2 i, we need to find the ÛN σ . From equation 95, we have

ÛN σ = √12 1 + η̂ † − η̂ .

QUESTION: How can the η in the previous equation be conjugates of each other?
Where’s the problem? This question boils down to the following. In order for η and
η † to be conjugates of each other, the consistency equation Gh T † = T † Ge needs to be
satisfied. That comes down to c†2 {t(1 − n̂2 ) − 4µn̂2 } = {(V − µ)n†2 + (t − µ)(1 − n̂2 )}c†2 ,
or, tc†2 = (V − µ)c†2 . Why should this work out in general?

Here we used the fact that He n̂1↑ is Hermitian as seen from its expression, and

the n̂1↑ = 1 subspace. Substituting the expression for He gives:

Ê1↑ n̂1↑ − U n̂1↑ n̂1↓ − U n̂2↑ n̂2↓ n̂1↑ + t(c†1↓ c2↓ + c†2↓ c1↓ )n̂1↑ = t2 n̂1↑ (1 − n̂2↑ )
4.1.1

N=2

We first look at the N = 2 portion of the n̂1↑ occupied subspace. The remaining degrees of
freedom are n̂1↓ , n̂2↑ and n̂2↓ . Notice that the working equation, eq. 138 involves the creation
and annihilation operators only for n̂1↓ and n̂2↓ . This means that n̂1↓ and n̂2↓ form a coupled
degree of freedom, and this is in turn decoupled from n̂2↑ .Out of the two electrons (N = 2),
one electron is already there at n̂1↑ . This leaves us with two possible subspaces to work in:
• P̂ = |1100i h1100| + |1001i h1001|
This is the subspace in which we keep n̂2↑ empty, and the second electron thus lie somewhere in the subspace spanned by n̂1↓ and n̂2↓ . The notation is obvious: |1100i ≡ |↑↓, 0i
and |1001i ≡ |↑, ↓i. In this subspace,
 the
 right hand side of eq. 138 is unity, because

n̂1↑ = 1 and n̂2↑ = 0. Define âx = 

Next we need to write the LHS in this subspace. Taking |1100i and |1001i as the basis
elements, we see that both c†2↓ c1↓ and c†1↓ c2↓ take one basis vector to the other, and
hence

c†1↓ c2↓ + c†2↓ c1↓ = 

Note that this is not the eigenvector for the total Hamiltonian, because it doesn’t include the contribution from n̂1↑ = 0 sector.
• P = |1010i h1010|
In the previous subspace, we set n̂2↑ = 0, so here we consider n̂2↑ = 1: Since n̂1↓ = n̂2↓ = 0,
we have U (n̂1↑ n̂1↓ + n̂2↑ n̂2↓ ) = 0 and c†1↓ c2↓ + c†2↓ c1↓ = 0. The RHS is also zero. This
means that in this subspace, the only eigenvalue is E = 0. The eigenvector is |↑, ↑i.
4.1.2

N=1

This case is simpler, because the only electron is placed at n̂1↑ . Thus, n̂1↓ = n̂2↑ = n̂2↓ = 0
in this subspace. Since the subspace has just one state, it is unidimensionl, and the equation
for this subspace will involve scalars instead of matrices. The RHS is hence t2 instead of
t2 a2x . Since there are no electrons in n̂1↓ or n̂2↓ , the creation and annihilation operators in
the LHS are zero:
(145)
n̂1↑ n̂1↓ + n̂2↑ n̂2↓ = c†1↓ c2↓ + c†2↓ c1↓ = 0
31

Eq. 138 thus reduces to
Ê1↑,1 = ±t

(146)

Ê1↑,1 is the projected Hamiltonian in this subspace. The eigenvalues in this subspace come
out to be ±t. Since the only state in this subspace is |↑, 0i, that is the contribution to the
eigenvectors.
4.1.3

N=3

With one electron at n̂1↑ , we have two electrons to place. There are two options:
• P̂ = |1110i h1110| + |1011i h1011|
Since the equation is diagonal in n̂2↑ , it makes sense to place one electron at n̂2↑ ,
and the other electron in the coupled subspace, that is, n̂1↓ and n̂2↓ . The corresponding projection operator is The RHS of eq. 138 in this subspace is 0, because n̂2↑ = 1.
This also means that

is unidimensional, and the equation is scalar.

These are the total eigenstates corresponding to eigenvalues U, 0.Consider the corresponding

These are the final states corresponding to the eigenvalues E± .
The final states to consider are the ones with zero eigenvalues, that is, |↑, ↑i for n̂1↑ = 1
†
and |↓, ↓i for n̂1↑ = 0. The action of Û1↑
on them is easy to see. Since η or η † annihilate one
spin up electron and create another spin up electron at a different site, it is clear that they
will give zero for both these states: |↓, ↓i has no spin up electron to annihilate, and |↑, ↑i
has no free site to create a spin up electron. Hence, the final eigenstates are
†
Û1↑
|↑, ↑i = |↑, ↑i
†
Û1↑
|↓, ↓i = |↓, ↓i

These have eigenvalues 0.
